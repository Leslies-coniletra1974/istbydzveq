Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo and man, I am having some weird feelings. Like, did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 about a woman in love with an amusement park ride? Is that a thing now? It’s like someone decided that inflatable flailing tube men weren’t romantic enough, so they went with... that. I don’t even know how I feel. Do I love it? Am I mildly disturbed? Maybe a bit of both. My brain feels like a browser with too many open tabs right now.

So, let me get this straight. Jeanne is in love with a tilt-a-whirl and, for some inexplicable reason, I found myself kind of rooting for it? Objectophilia they call it—fancy word for loving objects but they made it so darn sweet. I mean, if you squint real hard and forget that her love interest has bolts and possibly a maintenance crew, it's kind of touching in an I-can't-believe-this-is-happening sort of way. Whoever thought sparks would literally fly between humans and ferris wheels?!?

> Honestly, it’s sort of like when you're scrolling through late-night 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹 and you accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   thinking it's a fun rom-com, but SURPRISE! Yeah, that was my night right there. And I'm not sure if I want those two hours back or dive right into a detailed analysis of mechanical romance. The visuals were trippy, though—half nostalgia for my childhood trips to discount carnivals, half Is this what psychedelics feel like?

Is it weird that I found the whole thing oddly comforting? The way it challenges what love looks like was unexpectedly refreshing. Or maybe I'm just tired and over-identifying with machine parts after binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Transformers? I don't know. Life is a roller-coaster, quite literally in this case. And now, here I am, reevaluating my relationships with my toaster and my vacuum cleaner. How long until I start naming them? Come on, Henry the Hoover, you complete me. But ironically.

Ah screw it, if you're curious (or having a slow Sunday), 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . But don't say I didn’t warn you when you start seeing sparks with your dishwasher.

Here's a random snippet of code because, why not:
```csharp
class JumboLove {
    public void Express() {
        Console.WriteLine(Jeanne ❤️ Jumbo);
    }
}
```

Anyway, maybe Jumbo is a metaphor for something. Maybe it’s just a very avant-garde take on love and connection. Or maybe I’m trying to find deeper meaning in accidentally surreal cinema. Whatever. Amusement parks may close, but the ride never really ends, does it?
